# Switchboard On-Demand: Solana Pull Feed
This example demonstrates the use of Switchboard's On-Demand Feed.

</div>

## Getting Started

Configure the `anchor.toml` file to point to your solana wallet and the Solana cluster of your choice - Devnet, Mainnet, etc.

Then, to see the power of on-demand feeds, run the following:

```bash
anchor build
```
After building, take note of your program address and insert it in your program `lib.rs` file here:
*Note:* an easy command to view your recently built programm address - `anchor keys list`.
```typescript
declare_id!(“[YOUR_PROGRAM_ADDRESS]“);
```
Rebuild your program.
```bash
anchor build
```
Deploy your program, initialise the IDL.
Note: ensure you insert your program address in the IDL initialise command.

```bash
anchor deploy
anchor idl init --filepath target/idl/sb_on_demand_solana.json YOUR_PROGRAM_ADDRESS
```

Once deployed, you can run the demo script included here to test populating the feed:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm update
ts-node scripts/createFeed.ts
```
